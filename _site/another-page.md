Title: How AI outperforms humans at creative idea generation
Abstract:
This paper investigates the creative potential of artificial intelligence (AI), specifically the GPT4 large language model, in generating new product ideas. We first demonstrate that GPT4 can generate ideas that are rated as more creative than those generated by laypeople and creative professionals working under strong financial incentives. We then propose a novel text analysis methodology that we use to determine what specifically GPT4 is doing to achieve these superior results. We develop measures of two types of creativity: creative form (i.e., the language used to describe an idea being more unusual or unique) and creative substance (i.e., the idea itself is more novel). We find that GPT4 outperforms humans in both types of creativity. Finally, we show that using GPT4 to simply re-write ideas originally written by humans results in those ideas being rated as significantly more creative and that the improvement is explained by creativity in form. These results have immediate implications for managers, researchers, and practitioners in various fields, as integrating AI systems may optimize creative processes, save resources, and accelerate innovation cycles.
